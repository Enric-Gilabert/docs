# Compilers

Compilers are the component responsible to transform a **Query** instance to a SQL string that can be executed directly by the database engine.


## Supported compilers
Currently, SqlKata query builder supports natively the following compilers **SqlServer**, **MySql** and **PostgreSql**.

## Some noticeable difference
Theoretically the output of different compilers should be similar, this is true for the 80% of the cases, however in some edge cases the output can be very different, for instance take a look how the `Limit` and `Offset` clause get compiled in each compiler

```cs
new Query("Posts").Limit(10).Offset(20);
```

Sql Server
```sql
SELECT * FROM [Posts] ORDER BY (SELECT 0) OFFSET 20 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY
```

Sql Server &lt; 2012
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT 0)) AS [row_num] FROM [Posts]
) WHERE [row_num] BETWEEN 21 AND 30
```

MySql
```sql
SELECT * FROM `Posts` LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
```

PostgreSql

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Posts" LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
```

In this documentation, we will display the queries compiled by the SqlServer Compiler only, except for the queries where the output is not the same.

## Supporting Legacy SqlServer &lt; 2012
Set the **UseLegacyPagination** flag to true if you want to target legacy Sql Server.

```cs
var compiler = new SqlServerCompiler {
    UseLegacyPagination = true
}
```
